            Start by making the cheese mixture by combining the shredded cheese, cream, and chives (Image 1). Emmental cheese is the perfect cheese to use for German cheese spaetzle. 
            It has a savory but mild taste and melts quickly. 
            Combined with cream and chives it makes a creamy, cheesy melted deliciousness.
            In an oven-proof skillet (for example a Lodge Cast Iron Skillet) melt a generous amount of butter. 
            Add the cold spaetzle and sautee them for a few minutes. Keep tossing them so they cook evenly. (Image 2)
            When the spaetzle are golden-brown add the cheese mixture and stir until everything is evenly coated and the cheese has melted (Image 3). 
            Then transfer the pan to the oven and broil until the top is nicely browned and the cheese bubbles. Keep an eye on it so it doesnâ€™t burn. 
            This only takes a minute!
